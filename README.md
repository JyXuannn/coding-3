## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sirakr/houses-dataset

## Concept: 

With the development of the times, new styles of architecture are emerging all over the world, and some of the buildings combine different architectural styles to explore new possibilities.

Therefore, I searched for a database on architecture and I wanted to train architectural models from the DCGAN method in order to explore more architectural possibilities.

After downloading the dataset for the first time I chose the frontal part (about 500 photos, which I trained 10,000 times to ensure the final result).

However, I thought I could try to select more architectural styles to train, so I put in all the images from the dataset and started training (about 2000 images). So I only trained 2000 times, but I think the results are better than before.

There were too many images in the dataset so it was impossible to upload them. Just download the dataset and put it in the frontal folder in the data file and it will work. (The link to the dataset has been placed above)
