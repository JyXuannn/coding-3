## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sirakr/houses-dataset

## Concept: 

With the development of the times, new styles of architecture are emerging all over the world, and some of the buildings combine different architectural styles to explore new possibilities.

Therefore, I searched for a database on architecture and I wanted to train architectural models from the DCGAN method in order to explore more architectural possibilities.

After downloading the dataset for the first time I chose the frontal part (about 500 photos, which I trained 10,000 times to ensure the final result).(https://github.com/JyXuannn/coding-3/blob/main/generated_images_epoch_10000.png).
